# Editor Features & Recommendations

There's a wonderful selection of powerful editors these
days, but these are the two that I recommend considering.

These editors offer many, if not all the benefits that I listed previously.

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is currently one of the best editors available, however it's also
the only option on this list that isn't free, but it does offer a free 30-day trial.

At Virtually(Creative) we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) because it's free,
it's fast, it offers a built-in terminal, it has
excellent Git integration and node debugging, and it
boasts a rich plug-in ecosystem.

## Cool Story bro, but I'm back-end

When writing JavaScript it's easy to default to the
IDE that you already know. If you're a .NET developer,
Visual Studio will feel like a natural choice. And if
you're a Java developer, perhaps continuing to do all
your work in Eclipse or Netbeans seems the most logical.

Of course, these full-blown IDEs can certainly handle
JavaScript and much more. These are an okay option too,
but it's important to recognize that these IDEs aren't
as focused on supporting the latest features in
JavaScript. So don't feel obligated to use a single
editor for everything!

If you're currently writing code in a large IDE like one
of these, you owe it to yourself to check out the
lighter weight JavaScript editors I mentioned above.

I like to think about it like this: if you're writing
both front and back-end code, there's nothing wrong with
using a different editor on each side.

This is becoming increasingly common in a
service-oriented world, where the technologies that we
use on the back-end for services are completely
different than those that we use on the front-end.

Using different editors for front and back-end
development means that you're choosing the best tool for
the job for each scenario.
