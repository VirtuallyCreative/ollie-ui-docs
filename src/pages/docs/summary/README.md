# Ecosystem

Ollie is a rapid SPA starter kit meaning it makes little assumptions about what front-end stack you're going to use with it.

Out of the box, Ollie contains a micro CSS framework also made by Virtually(Creative) called, [Allegretto](https://allegretto.herokuapp.com).

This light-weight framework helps with making simple layouts with easy to pick-up selectors, helpers and utility classes.

- Fast and lively (~9kb gziped). With Unpkg CDN goodness.
- Build with Accessability in mind; A.O.D.A / W.C.A.G.
- Great for quick wireframing/prototyping
- Simple 12-Col grid using flexbox
- Easy to extend with your own CSS variables
- Comes with a handful of components & utils
- Expects proper HTML5 semantic markup
- Normalize CSS reset baked in
- No Pre-Processer here, just vanilla CSS-3

But, you can easily swap it out for whatever front-end framework you wish - a few favourites at Virtually(Creative) are listed below!

## Allegretto CSS

To replace it, swap the Allegretto reference in the `<head>` tag in `/src/index.ejs`.

```html
  <!-- Load Allegretto from CDN -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/allegretto@latest/dist/retto.min.css" type="text/css" media="all">
```
