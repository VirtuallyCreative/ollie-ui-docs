## How to contribute to Ollie Framework

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Node or dependant module**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://virtuallycreative.ca/opensource-security/).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/VirtuallyCreative/ollie-ui/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/VirtuallyCreative/ollie-ui/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Ollie Framework](https://spectrum.chat/ollie-framework) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Ollie will generally not be accepted (read more about [my rationales behind this decision](https://spectrum.chat/ollie-framework#cosmetics)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* Suggest your change in the [Ollie Framework Discussion](https://spectrum.chat/ollie-framework) then start writing code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ollie Framework in the [Ollie Framework Discussion Community](https://spectrum.chat/ollie-framework).

#### Thank you
