# Ollie Starter Kit

The purpose of Ollie is to work smart, not hard.
Do you like to fail fast?
When you make a typo in your JS, do you want to know as soon as possible?
When a test fails, would you like to know immediately?
Are you overwhelmed by the number of options that are available in the JavaScript space today?

Those are just a few of the reasons that I created the Ollie starter kit.

There are over 40 out-of-the-gate decisions that you might consider when creating a robust JavaScript development environment and after setting up for 100's of projects,

**If you can make all of these decisions just once, then every future project can benefit from a solid foundation.**

Wouldn't it be nice if all these best practices were baked in your team's starter kit for future projects?

Starting from scratch really isn't practical anymore. If you or your team is starting from scratch on each new project, they're going
to spend weeks tripping over all of these decisions and boilerplate to get to the point that they have a solid
development experience.

The goal with Ollie is to speed development and increase quality by reducing the list of things that you need to set up, do manually, or try to remember on each new project.

So what's the big benefit of gathering your team together, and either selecting a starter kit or building your own?

Well first, it codifies a long list of decisions, best practices, and lessons learned. It also encourages consistency.
It protects your or your team from forgetting important details. It increases quality because doing the right thing becomes automatic.

If you want your team to consistently do the right things, it's really valuable to make sure that doing the right thing
is the easy thing. And finally, it avoids repeating work. You shouldn't have to think about how to handle minification,
automation, transpiling, bundling, cache-busting and more every time you start a new project. A starter kit
encapsulates all these decisions for you.

See, today's list of best practices is just too long for any one individual developer to track. So, Ollie does it for you - right out of the gate.
