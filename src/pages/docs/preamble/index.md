The purpose of Ollie-UI is to work smart, not hard.
- Do you like to fail fast?
- When you make a typo in your JS, do you want to know as soon as possible?
- When a test fails, would you like to know immediately?
- Are you overwhelmed by the number of options that are available in the JavaScript space today?

Those are just a few of the reasons that I created the Ollie-UI starter kit.

There are over 40 out-of-the-gate decisions that you might consider when creating a robust JavaScript development environment and after setting up for 100's of projects, if you can make all of these decisions just once then every future project can benefit from a solid foundation.

Wouldn't it be nice if all these best practices were baked in a starter kit for future projects?

Starting from scratch really isn't practical anymore. If you or your team is starting from scratch on each new project, they're going to spend a lot of valuable development time over all of these decisions and boilerplate to get to the point that they have a solid development experience.

The goal with Ollie-UI is to speed development and increase quality by reducing the list of things that you need to set up, do manually, or try to remember on each new project.

So what's the big benefit of gathering your team together, and either selecting a starter kit or building your own?

First, it codifies long lists of decisions, best practices, and lessons learned. It encourages consistency.
It protects your or your team from forgetting important details. It increases code quality and team productivity because doing the right thing becomes automatic.

If you want your team to consistently "do the right things", it's really valuable to make sure that "doing the right thing"
is the easy thing.

Most importantly, it avoids repeating work. In this case, following DRY priciples is important.
You shouldn't have to think about how to handle minification, automation, transpiling, bundling, cache-busting and more every time you start a new project. A starter kit encapsulates all these decisions for you.

It's 2020, today's list of best practices is just too long for any one individual developer to track. So, Ollie-UI does it for you - right out of the gate.
