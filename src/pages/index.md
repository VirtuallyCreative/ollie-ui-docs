      Ollie-UI is a culmination of ~50 front-end developer decisions typically
      made when starting a new project, so to never repeat myself going forward
      (DRY) I've bundled these decisions together into this starter-kit and
      thought I'd open-source these decisions to help others, receive feedback
      and so we can all improve together.

      Nope. Ollie-UI is not a JavaScript framework. 


      Ollie-UI is a starter-kit that simply builds upon ExpressJS. It provides a
      very familiar work-space for most developers focused on Front-End
      development to rapidly consume JSON data via a mock REST API. It's great
      for building front-end components, layouts or templates around mock data
      structure(s).
