      Ollie-UI is a culmination of 50+ front-end developer decisions that are
      made when starting a new project, so to never repeat myself going forward
      I've bundled these decisions together into this starter-kit.

      No. Ollie-UI is not a JavaScript framework. Ollie-UI is a starter-kit that
      builds upon ExpressJS to provide a very familiar work-space for most
      developers focused on Front-End to rapidly consume JSON data via REST API
      and build front-end components, layouts or templates around that data.
